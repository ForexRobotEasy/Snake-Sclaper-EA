## Product Description

The Snake Scalper EA is an automated forex trading software developed by the Forex Robot Easy team. It is designed to execute fast trades based on a scalping strategy. The EA trades on three currency pairs: EURUSD, USDJPY, and GBPUSD.

**Features:**
- **Lot Size:** The user can define the lot size for trading.
- **Stop Loss:** The user can set the stop loss in points.
- **Take Profit:** The user can set the take profit in points.
- **Trailing Stop:** The user can enable trailing stop functionality and set the trailing stop level in points.
- **Max Spread:** The user can set the maximum allowed spread in points.
- **Slippage:** The user can set the maximum allowed slippage in points.

The Snake Scalper EA checks if the market conditions are suitable for trading by verifying the spread and the presence of any open positions. If the conditions are suitable, the EA executes the scalping strategy.

The scalping strategy involves placing buy stop and sell stop orders at breakout levels. The breakout level is calculated as the current ask price plus the spread and the stop loss level. The EA then sets the take profit level based on the user-defined take profit parameter.

If the trailing stop functionality is enabled, the EA adjusts the trailing stop levels based on market conditions. If a position is in profit, the EA calculates a new stop loss level by adding the trailing stop level to the open price. The EA then modifies the position's stop loss level accordingly.
